Due to high security reason  git cannot allow us to push our trained model ,for that reason we cannot share our model structure.
We give our drive link to download our model **https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-FXaLlB2kmiEW-US3IXzZ3Kr5jTT93om/view?usp=sharing**
**User can use pre-trained models or they can use their own trained models**
Create virtual enviourment, then active the venv . After activate the venv install the requirements.txt file.You can change our model app.py file. then you can run app.py file
